# How openSCADpm works.

## Intro
openSCADpm provides the functionality of NPM for Node.js or Gems for Ruby. While a tutorial exists for how to use openSCADpm this document serves to explain how openSCADpm provides that functionality. There are several parts to this:

1. How openSCADpm interacts with GitHub

2. How openSCADpm interacts wtih with the user.

3. How openSCADpm interacts with the openSCAD library system.

## Interactions with GitHub

Given the populaitry of Github as a platform to host opensource (and closed-source) software we found a tight integration with the platform had several advantages:

* GitHub is easy to browse.
  * It allows topical tags.
  * Open access to repoistories.
* GitHub is free. 
  * Hosting funding is a non-issue.
  * More people can contribute this way.
  * openSCADpm can continue to exist without coninous funding.
* Github has a built in system for making releases.
  * This provides a standardized method.
  * Releases can be easily browsed.
  * Releases can be easily created and documented.
* Easy and realiable downloads.
* Trusted source for downloads.
